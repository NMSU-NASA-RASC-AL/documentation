# Contributing Guide for the NASA RASC-AL Team
## 1. The Most Important Rule...
The "main" branch serves as our safe zone. The code in the "main" branch should always work. Considering this, ***please do not directly edit the code in this branch***.
## 2. How to Add New Stuff
Whenever you want to make edits to the code, create a new branch. Creating a new branch allows you to edit code in your own personal workspace, without interfering with the main branch.
The following command will allow you to simultaneously create a branch and make it your current working branch:
`git checkout -b <branch-name>`
## 3. Saving Your Work
When you save your changes (or as GitHub calls it, "commit"), please identify what changes you made to the code and what purpose the change serves.
## 4. Wrapping Up
When the code you are working on is effective, upload (push) your branch from your computer to GitHub, and open a "pull request." This allows other team members to view your changes to the code, question them, and suggest changes. Once the code is adequate, the code will be confirmed and merged into the main branch.
